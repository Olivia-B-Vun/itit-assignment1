        <h1>Where Am I Going?</h1>
        <h6>I <em>Might</em> Be Lost</h6>
        <p>At this point in time, my ideal role would be a Full Stack Developer or Engineer role. Not only will I be responsible 
            for coming up with innovative solutions to problems, but I will also be responsible for implementing and testing 
            solutions along with my team.
        </p>
        <h2>What I Have Going for Me?</h2>
        <p>I don’t feel I hit any of the technical aspects, but I hit a lot of the interpersonal aspects; for instance, 
            despite being introverted (and based on my 16Personalities results; a robot) I’m extremely people focussed, 
            I’m passionate about enabling others to succeed and I’m very patient when mentoring staff and colleagues.
        </p>
        <h2>What I Need?</h2>
        <p>Based on further research it sounds like I’m probably going to need a good understanding of both Front-End software 
            languages and frameworks like HTML, JavaScript, and JSON as well as Back End software languages and frameworks like 
            PHP, Python, Node.js and C#.
        </p>
        <h2>How Do I Get There?</h2>
        <p>Doing this course is probably a good start but, here are the steps I think I shoudl take:
