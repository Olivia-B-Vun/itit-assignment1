        <h1>Potential Project Idea</h1>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <h6>Hint: It's Me!</h6>
        <p>
            I really like organisation, and everything fits into a neat little box. 
            To facilitate this, I use a range of online and offline tools. Some of the tools I currently use include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dog Board</li>
            <li>Google Calendar & Google Sheets</li>
            <li>House Board</li>
            <li>My Fitness Pal</li>
            <li>Stronglifts</li>
            <li>Trello</li>
            <li>Whiteboard</li>
        </ul>
            <img src = "images/project-img/dogboard.jpg" class = "center-no-pad">
            <img src = "images/project-img/google-sheets.PNG" class = "center-no-pad">
            <img src = "images/project-img/google-calendar.PNG" class = "center-no-pad">
            <img src = "images/project-img/Trello.PNG" class = "center-no-pad">
            <img src = "images/project-img/adhd-board.jpg" class = "center-no-pad">
        <p>
            As you can imagine, it’s a lot of manual work to keep the information up to date and there are a lot of redundancies. 
            However, the biggest issue is <strong>object permanence</strong> or rather, the lack thereof. My solution to this is 
            to have one mobile application that does the lot, provides you with relevant notifications but also gives you the 
            option to turn off functionality that isn’t required. 
        </p>
        <h2>Market Research</h2>
        <p>
            Similar apps definitely exist on the market. However, after doing the research, it seems that a majority
            of these applications only perform on function. Based on this, I had two main take-aways: <br> The first,
            many of the foud during my market research were available on both Android and iOS, with only a handful being platform 
            “exclusives” or web applications (Schedule Once & ADHD Tracker 1.0). This meant that someone who utilised multiple 
            devices to organise their daily lives didn’t have to download and install multiple applications to track the same 
            information. <br>But the main issue that resulted from my market research; which ultimately rendered point one 
            moot; is that an end user who utilised these sorts of tools had to download multiple applications to paint a full 
            picture.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools & Skills</h2>
        <p>
            Because this application needs to be cross-platform I’m probably not going to want to use something like Swift 
            which is used predominantly in iOS application development or Kotlin for Android.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, I’m going to stick 
            with the devil I (sort of) know and build this app in JavaScript. <br>Not only is JavaScript relatively robust, 
            React Native is great for cross-platform development. The other upside to this, is that it’s almost as old as I 
            am so, finding a developer with the skills required to create the application will be a piece of cake, and better yet, 
            finding an IDE that can support the language is even easier. <br>Finally, by using JavaScript, I can then build a 
            Hybrid App and use one codebase for both operating systems resulting in easier maintenance and updates.
        </p>
        <h2>MVP</h2>
        <h3>Calendar</h3>
            <p>
                This feature would track regular events such as birthday and bills, task due dates (pulled from the 
                o do list). It should have the ability to change the calendar view so that the end user can see hour 
                by hour (or in x minute increments) what my day looks like; thus, allowing me to implement timetabling.
            </p>
        <h3>To-Do List</h3>
            <p>
                This feature (like a Kanban board on Trello) will allow an end user to track ad-hoc tasks such as organising an 
                appointment and regular tasks such as chores. From there, I would like to be able to set due dates that 
                appear on the calendar and send a push notification to the user's phone
            </p>
        <h3>Notifications</h3>
            <p>
                Object permanence has been a big factor in this project; so naturally, the ability to have notifications 
                appear on the lock screen of an end user’s phone is a MUST.
