        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <h6>Hint: It's Me!</h6>
        <p>If you know me (which I will assume you don’t) I really like organisation, and everything fits into a neat little box. 
            To facilitate this, I use a range of online and offline tools. Some of the tools I currently use include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dog Board</li>
            <li>Google Calendar & Google Sheets</li>
            <li>House Board</li>
            <li>My Fitness Pal</li>
            <li>Stronglifts</li>
            <li>Trello</li>
            <li>Whiteboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can imagine, it’s a lot of manual work to keep the information up to date and based on the 
            functionality descriptions (of the above tools) alone, there are a lot of redundancies. However, 
            the one issue that I (and I’m sure many others like me face) is that once the app is closed, or 
            I’ve turned away from the board; it ceases to function. Object permanence doesn’t exist and it’s 
            not a concept that my brain seems willing to understand.</p>
