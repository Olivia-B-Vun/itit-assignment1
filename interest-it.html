        <h1>You, Me and IT</h1>
        <p>Straight out of highschool I actually completed a Bachelor of Music; I wanted to make my family proud but not so proud
            that I could get a "real" job; infact, I absolutely <strong>hated</strong> my first support role! But the challenge of 
            troubleshooting issues within the applications I supported, really put me on the path to where I am today.
        </p>
        <div class = "center-no-pad">
            <div class = "responsive">
                <img src = "images/it-img/it-crowd.gif" alt = "Turning it on and off again" >
             </div>
        </div>
        <p>I currently work as a support consultant in the HR industry and a large portion of my role is creating dynamic 
            workflows based on a clientâ€™s industry and the positions they may hire for using JavaScript. I also use Java to write
            equations to help calculate figures such as total remuneration packages, superannuation entitlements, bonus' etc.
        </p>
        <p>Whilst I don't exactly know where I"m going, or what I want from this course; I've been really enjoying the more
            code dependant side of my job.
        </p>
